# vling

A portal for linguistic competitions practice, in the ilk of NACLO/IOL, built with React. 

Contains problems (retyped into markdown format) and my own solutions/walkthroughs: my intent is to contribute a resource to any aspiring linguist-er interested in competitions, particularly since in my own prep I found resources scarce and intuition nonexistent. 

My methods of solving are not necessarily the most efficient, and I likely won't get around to writing solutions for every single problem. Hence, if you'd like to contribute, just make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches). Any new solutions, alternate solutions, or problem writeups (existing or your own!) are welcome. 

If you'd like to contribute code, make a pull request addressing any [open issues](https://github.com/blobotic/vling/issues).

If you'd like to suggest any features or point out any bugs, feel free to [open](https://github.com/blobotic/vling/issues/new) a new issue. 

I aim to eventually implement better answer validation (LCS then experimenting with [paraphrasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrasing_(computational_linguistics))) and to develop a way to work on problems in browser, without needing pen and paper (arbitrary highlighting + copying and rearranging of rows in tables would be the first step).
