Breton is a language spoken by approximately 200,000 people in Brittany, France. Part of the Celtic family of
the Indo-European languages, it is distantly related to English, as well as other European languages such as
French and Russian.

Below are some equations in Breton:

:::div{.center}
**trizek + daouzek = pemp warn ugent**
<br>**unan ha pevar-ugent ÷ nav = nav**
<br>**pevar ha tri-ugent − ugent = pevar ha daou-ugent**
<br>**seizh warn ugent + pevarzek = unan ha daou-ugent**
<br>**daou × seizh = pevarzek**
<br>**kant ÷ daou = hanter kant**
<br>**nav × c’hwec’h = pevar ha hanter kant**
<br>**c’hwec’h ha tri-ugent ÷ tri = daou warn ugent**
<br>**c’hwezek × c’hwec’h = c’hwezek ha pevar-ugent**
<br>**daouzek × pemp = tri-ugent**
:::


**E1.** Fill in the gaps in the following equations.

:::div{.lmargin2}
a. pevar-ugent ÷ pemp = :ans{.sm}
<br>b. pemp ha hanter kant − daouzek = :ans{.sm}
<br>c. nav warn ugent + :ans{.sm} = tri ha daou-ugent
<br>d. kant ÷ :ans{.sm} = pemp

**E2.** As well as an interesting numbering system, Breton has an unusual method of forming the plurals of
some nouns, which is partly connected to the numbering system. Here are three plural nouns in Breton:
which of them means “(one person’s) eyes”? Circle the word.

:::table{.border-hidden .width-800}
::tr[:td[**(a)** elerc’h] :td[**(b)** daoulagad] :td[**(c)** perennoù]]
:::

:div[Word: :ans]{.lmargin2}

**E3.** An “irregular” number in the Breton system is *triwec’h*. It represents a number between 10 and 20.
Which one?
