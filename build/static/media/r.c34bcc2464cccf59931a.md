Arapaho is an Algonquian language spoken by about 1,000 people in Wyoming and Oklahoma. Here are some
Arapaho nouns in several forms and their English translations. Note that the shaded cells indicate that the
form does not exist.

Notes: ʔ and θ are both consonants. ʔ is a glottal stop, the sound in the middle of “uh-oh,” and θ is pronounced like the “th” in the English word “think.” Arapaho pronunciation also involves tones, which have not
been included in this problem.

The *obviative*, sometimes called the “fourth person,” is a noun form used in some languages to express how
relevant an entity is. If some third-person entities (i.e., ones that are neither the speaker nor the listener) are
less important than others to the conversation, they will be given the obviative marking, while the more important ones will take the standard third-person marking. The *locative* is a noun form used to indicate a location – e.g., the locative form of “field” would mean “in the field” or “on the field.”
