Cornish (known in Cornish as Kernewek) is the Celtic language of the county of Cornwall (Kernow) in South
West England. It stopped being actively spoken in the late 1700s, but knowledge of the language survived,
and since the early 1900s, attempts have been made to revive it. Currently, there is a growing number of
second language speakers, as well as some children who are being brought up speaking Cornish.
