This short text is a slightly simplified excerpt from a story told to the author of the problem by an elder
of the Mẽbêngôkre people, an indigenous group from central Brazil. The anteater, also called *giant anteater*, is a large mammal that feeds on termites and has very powerful front legs that
end in long, curved nails that allow it to destroy termite nests. A tinamou
is a bird that looks like a partridge.

The translations of each line of the narrative are very literal. However, words in Mẽbêngôkre do not necessarily follow the same order as in French or English, and sometimes the words of a language are not present in the other. When something is in square brackets in the translation, it is either a clarification,
or the addition of a word which is implied but which is not expressed in the Mẽbêngôkre text, and which is necessary to fully understand it.

The names of the animals in the story are: **rop**, **bri**, **pàt**, **atoroti**.

**D1:** Translate the following expressions into English:

::tr[:td[**a. rop ne pĩ mã pa owadjà**] :td[:ans{.med}] :td[**f. ba pĩ pa o pĩ nhõpôk**] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[**b. ga pàt ’ỳrỳ aprõt**] :td[:ans{.med}] :td[**g. ba tu nhỹ**] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[**c. ba rop pyma je mã tẽ**] :td[:ans{.med}] :td[**h. bri ne mã tẽ**] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[**d. ba pĩ pa kuni kaba**] :td[:ans{.med}] :td[**i. rop ne bôx**] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[**e. atoroti ne ipa kane**] :td[:ans{.med}] :td[**j. pàt no kanhĩn ne apa 'ã**] :td[:ans{.med}]]

**D2:** There are two different words in the story which are translated as and. Which ones, and when do we use one or the other?

**Note:** The "stressed" vowels represent particular vowels of Mẽbêngôkre: those with a tilde **(~)** are nasal vowels, the **y** is a vowel between *ou* and *u*, but with unrounded lips, the **ê** is like the *é* in French, the **ỳ** is a slightly more open vowel than *y*, and the **à** a more open vowel than *ỳ* but less than *a*. The **dj**, **nh** are consonants which are pronounced like the *j* in *jean* and like
the *gn* in *oignon*, respectively. The **’** represents the "glottal stop", pronounced like the interruption in the vibration of the vocal cords produced between the vowels of *oh-oh*. The **r** represents an *r* like
that of *cara* in Spanish or like the *tt* of *better* in English.
