The following 14-line poem is one of the four sections of a grammar of Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language,
written by the 4th-century BCE Indian grammarian Pāṇini. It is called the Akṣarasamāmnāya or Śivasūtras,
and it functions as an ordering of the sounds of the Sanskrit language[^1]
– like the English “A, B, C…” with some
special properties.

**NOTE:** *ṛ* and *ḷ* are vowels; *ñ*, *n̄*, *ṇ*, *ḍ*, *ṭ*, *ś*, and *ṣ* are consonants. A consonant with a letter *h* after it (e.g. *jh*) is
considered a separate ‘sound’ from the consonant without the *h* (e.g. *j*). The vowels *a i u* each have a long
counterpart, *ā ī ū*, which for purposes of the *Śivasūtras* is considered equivalent with the short form.

The organization of the *Śivasūtras* allows us to give names to certain groups of sounds. For example, the single syllable *aC* refers to the vowels (*a i u ṛ ḷ e o ai au*). Similarly, *haL* refers to the consonants (all the sounds
that are not vowels), and *yaṆ* refers to a specific class of consonants (*y v r l*). Each of these single-syllable
words (and the group of sounds that it describes) is known as a *pratyāhāra*.

**L1.** To what do the following *pratyāhāras* refer? List the sounds:

**L2.** Give the pratyāhāras for the following classes.

::tr[:td[(i) ...ñ m n̄ṇ n (nasal consonants)] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(ii) ...ai au (diphthongs)] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(iii) ...all sounds] :td[:ans{.med}]]
:::

**L3.** Explain how to form a pratyāhāra.
:expl

You may have noticed that, in English, the same thing can be pronounced differently in different contexts.
For example, the words *a* and *an* mean the same thing, but we use *a* before consonants and *an* before
vowels. Such rules can often be described as a substitution operation performed under a specified set of
conditions, such as “substitute *an* for *a* before a vowel.”

An advantage of the *pratyāhāras* is that they can be used to efficiently describe such sound change processes, which often operate on the types of sound groupings that can be expressed as *pratyāhāras*.[^2]
Approximately 4,000 rules describing the sound change processes of Sanskrit are laid out in another section of
Pāṇini’s grammar, known as the *Aṣṭādhyāyī*.
Here is an example of a rule from the *Aṣṭādhyāyī*:

:div[**6.1.77** *iKaḥ yaṆ aCi*]{.lmargin2}

This rule contains three *pratyāhāras*: *iK*, *yaṆ*, and *aC*, which you have already seen in the previous part of this
problem. Each of these *pratyāhāras* is followed by an ending (the ending may be empty, in which case it is
marked by the symbol *∅*):

:div[**6.1.77** *iK-aḥ yaṆ-∅aC-i*]{.lmargin2}

[^2]: In technical linguistic terminology, groups of sounds that have meaningful linguistic roles, such as the set of
consonants or the set of vowels, are known as natural classes; *pratyāhāras* are generally natural classes.


Here are a few of the changes triggered by this rule 6.1.77; the underlying form is the form before the rule
has been applied, while the written form is the result of applying the rule:

:::div{.width-800}
| Underlying form | Written form | Translation |
|-|-|-|
| muniāśrama | munyāśrama | ‘the sages’ hermitage’
| devīeva | devyeva | ‘the goddess herself’
| madhuiva | madhviva | ‘like honey’
| pitṛaśva | pitraśva | ‘the father’s horse’
:::

However, the following forms are not affected by rule 6.1.77 (although they may be affected by other rules):

:::div{.no1Count .no2Count .width-800}
| Underlying  form | Translation
| -|-|
| munitapas | ‘the sages’ asceticism’
| kanyāeva | ‘the girl herself’
| dhenusiva | ‘like a cow’
| kimcit | ‘something’
:::

In everyday contexts in Sanskrit, the endings seen above (-aḥ, -∅, -i) are used to mark the role of a noun in a
sentence. For example, from the noun manas ‘mind’ the following forms are derived:

:::div{.width-800}
| Form|  Translation | Role in the sentence 
|-|-|-|
| manas-∅ | ‘the mind (does, is, etc.)’  | subject 
| manas-aḥ | ‘of the mind’  | possessor 
| manas-i | ‘on the mind’  | location 
:::

However, within the Aṣṭādhyāyī these endings have a slightly different meaning.

**L4.** Express in your own words the meaning of rule 6.1.77.

:expl

**L5.** How would you translate the meaning of the following endings as they are used in the *Aṣṭādhyāyī*?

:::table{.border-hidden .no1Count .no2Count }
::tr[:td[(i) …-aḥ?] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(ii) …-∅?] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(iii) …-i?] :td[:ans{.med}]]
:::

**L6.** The following is a simplified version of rule 8.4.53 of the Aṣṭādhyāyī: jhaLaḥ jaŚ jhaŚi. For each of the following underlying forms, write the corresponding written form; if the form is unaffected, write “no change.”

:::table{.border-hidden .no1Count .no2Count .width-1200 }
::tr[:td[(i) jagatdhana ‘the wealth of the universe’] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(ii) tatduḥkha ‘that sorrow’] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(iii) bhrātṛnāman ‘brother’s name’] :td[:ans{.med}]]
:::

Note that the designations of the rules (6.1.77, 8.4.53) refer to book, chapter, and line numbers of the
Aṣṭādhyāyī.
