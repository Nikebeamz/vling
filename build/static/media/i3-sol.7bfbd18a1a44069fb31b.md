particles:
- xae - question with two parts
- ke - declarative
- kee - declarative with two parts

ke kacuuʔi ŋ = asks if

ends with ŋǁa when two-part question (i.e. xae) but not yes/no, or when declarative with two parts (i.e. kee), and with ŋ otherwise

We use the ɡǀV form of a pronoun when at the beginning of a question or after ŋ.

> 18\. na ǁu si sĩisen ŋ ɡǃari :sol[I will not work in Upington.]<br>

> 21\. cuu xae u ŋǀii :sol[Whom do you:sub[pl] see?]<br>
> 22\. cuu xae ts’aaʔa ŋ :sol[Who likes me?]<br>

and **(b)**:
