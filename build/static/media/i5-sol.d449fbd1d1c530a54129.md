This problem is fairly easy; we simply need to match sounds. Note that a common pitfall might be mapping Proto-Chamic -> Phan Rang Cham -> Tsat; there is no need to do this. 

We examine Phan Rang Cham first, and Tsat later.

We can break up each combination of letters (consonant -> vowel -> [optional final consonant]) by syllables, denoting vowels by V and consonants by C. Going down the list and going back and generalizing as much as possible, we get the following patterns. 

First syllable:
- ʔV -> i 
- di -> ta
- ja -> ca
- l? -> li (from *lima, *lanah, *dua lapan, *labaːt)
- dVV -> tà
- ba(r/l) -> pi (from *bara, *bulow) (note that it helps to know that r/l are similar or indistinguishable in many languages)
- bah -> pi
- pa -> pa
- ma -> mɨ
- ba -> pa
