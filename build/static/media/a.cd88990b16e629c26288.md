Wayúu is an Arawak language spoken by approximately 400,000 people on the Guajira Peninsula, on the border between Colombia and Venezuela.

In Wayúu, the accent falls on one of the first three syllables of a word, following certain rules. Here are some examples of words with the accent indicated by the acute accent (◌́) on the vowel that receives it. 

Because the source of this data does not provide a translation for some of these words, we only present the forms here. Their translations are not necessary to solve this problem.

**Note:** The **’** represents a consonant, the glottal stop, pronounced like the sound between the vowels of *oh-oh*. The **ü** represents a vowel halfway between the *u* and the *ou* in French, but pronounced without rounding the lips. The **ch** and the **sh** each represent a single consonant: the *tch* and the *ch* in French,
respectively. The **j** represents the sound of the *h* in English. The **r** is a sound between *r* and *l*, unique to Wayúu. The other letters have a pronunciation similar to their pronunciation in French.
