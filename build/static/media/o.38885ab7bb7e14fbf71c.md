Vengo is the language of the Vengo ethnic group which consists of approximately 14,000 people living predominantly in the village Vengo in Cameroon.[^1]
The words in this problem are presented in the writing system
of the language. The symbol ʼ represents the glottal stop (the consonantal sound we produce between the
vowels in the English expression *uh-oh*).

Compounding is a common word formation process in Vengo. Similarly to English, compounds are variably
written as one word, two words, or two hyphenated words in Vengo. Each Vengo word in the column on the
left has its English translation (which is explicitly marked as a noun *(n.)* or a verb *(v.)* for clarity) somewhere in
the column on the right, but the translations are in a scrambled order.

|Babungo|English|
|-|-|
| tɔ | horn *(n.)*|
| fɔ wi | head *(n.)*|
| nyaa shiŋii | stay *(v.)*|
| tɔŋii | hospital *(n.)*|
| nyaa | climb/climb onto *(v.)*|
| shiŋii | gun *(n.)*|
| fɔ | medicine *(n.)*|
| nyaa yiko’ | house *(n.)*|
| wi | ladder *(n.)*|
| shi | gunpowder *(n.)*|
| nyaa ndaw | roof *(n.)*|
| ŋii | bull *(n.)*|
| ko’ | home *(n.)*|
| ndaw | pet *(n.)*|
| ŋii-vəfɔ | horse *(n.)*|
| vəko’ | animal *(n.)*|


**O1.** Match each Vengo entry (1-16) to its English translation (A-P).

[^1]: Speakers of the language call their village Vengo and their language Ghang Vengo [ɣáŋ vəŋóo]; however, the village is officially
called Babungo and appears with this name on maps of Cameroon, and the language is, therefore, often referred to as Babungo.
