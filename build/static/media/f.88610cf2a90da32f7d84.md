Paiwan is an Austronesian language spoken by around 66,000 people in southern Taiwan. One of the major
components of Paiwan sentence structure is “focus,” which marks a new piece of information conveyed by
the sentence. In English, we might represent this through phrasing, such as in sentence “It is ***the dog*** which
the man likes”. In this example, ***the dog*** is focused.

Below are some sentences in Paiwan with their English translations. Sentence elements in ***italics*** are focused.

| Paiwan | English |
| -|-|
| kanan nua uqaɬay tua kuka a quma nua tsakaw |The man eats the chicken in ***the thief’s field***.
| tjmalaw tua vavuy a kuvatu |***My dog*** angers the pig.
| djavisen nua tsemas a kukama |The spirit snatches ***my father***.
| sitarang nua uqaɬay a vuluq |The man protects (it) with ***the spear***.
| tjalawen nua suvavuy i tua umaq a aɬak nua vavaian |Your pig angers ***the woman’s child*** in the house.
| kman tua kuka a tsemas |***The spirit*** eats the chicken.
| djavisan nua pulingaw tua vuluq a gadu |The shaman snatches the spear in ***the mountain***.
| langedaen nua sivitay a qaya-qayam |The soldier hears ***the bird***.

(The letter pairs **dj** and **tj** each represent a single sound. The word **langedaen** in sentence 8 is actually
**langedain**, but this was edited for the sake of simplicity.)
