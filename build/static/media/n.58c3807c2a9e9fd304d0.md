Dinka is a Nilotic dialect cluster with about 1.3 million native speakers, mostly ethnic Dinka people in South Sudan.
There are several main varieties, but this problem focuses on the Agar dialect.

When linguists first studied the language, they believed that the singular and plural forms of Dinka nouns were
completely unpredictable. More recently, however, studying the way that verbs conjugate in Dinka allowed linguists to
find patterns in the singular and plural forms. This has allowed many nouns to be grouped according to common
patterns, although many remain unexplained.

Below are 22 Dinka nouns, in both singular and plural forms, each of which follow one of the common patterns. The
translations have been provided only for interest: they have no bearing on the solution to the problem.

**Notes:** **ɛ** is the vowel in “bed”, and **ɔ** is the vowel in “bought”. Dinka has three vowel lengths: short (e.g., **a**), medium
(e.g., **aa**), long (e.g., **aaa**); as well as three tones, high (e.g., **á**), low (e.g., **à**), falling (e.g., **â**). **j** and **w** are semivowels,
pronounced like the first sounds in “yes” and “with” respectively. **t**, ̪**d̪**, **ɲ**, **ɟ** and **ŋ** are consonants; how consonants are
pronounced is not relevant for this problem. While it is not strictly necessary for solving the problem, it may be helpful
to know that vowels can be classified by (among other things) height, i.e., how high or low the tongue is in the mouth
during their pronunciation. In this problem, **i** and **u** are high, **e** and **o** are high-mid, **ɛ** and **ɔ** are low-mid, and a is low.
