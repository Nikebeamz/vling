We can divide each script by verb roots:

:::table{.no1Count .no2Count .width-800 .center}
::tr[:td[vtkvi, tkvi] :td[you say, I said, you said]]
::tr[:td[kenit, vkeni] :td[we dine, I will dine]]
::tr[:td[inadiret, nadirob, vinadire] :td[you hunt, I hunted, you (pl.) hunted]]
::tr[:td[itavmGdomareve, vitavmGdomareve] :td[you (pl.) did, I did, you (pl.) will do]]
::tr[:td[vsadilobt, visadileb] :td[we will walk]]
::tr[:td[vigoreb] :td[I presided, you presided]]
::tr[:td[ambob] :td[I will roll]]
::tr[:td[izamt] :td[]]
::tr[:td[vivlit] :td[]]
:::

We note that there are two more roots in Georgian, so two of the verbs likely involve a stem change in one of the tenses (particularly, amongst the verbs that correspond to to say, to hunt, or to do). 

We can begin by counting; we notice prefixes `v-` and `-i-`, as well as suffixes `-t`, `-e`, `-ob`, and `-eb`; we count the most obvious first, i.e. `v-`. There are eight Georgian words with a `v-` prefix, and we count that there are in fact eight first person phrases in English, so we let `v-` denote first person. 

We now examine the suffix `-t`; because there exist two words prefixed by `v-` and suffixed by `-t`, while there exists more than two phrases of each tense in English, we conclude that `-t` denotes plurality, i.e. `v[x]t` denotes "we", while `[x]t` denotes "you (pl.)". We thus conclude that :sol[vivlit = we will walk] and :sol[vsadilobt = we dine], so :sol[visadileb = I will dine]. 

Since inadiret/nadirob/vinadire has exactly one plural, we conclude that :sol[inadiret = you (pl.) hunted], :sol[nadirob = you hunt], and :sol[vinadire = I hunted].

Because kenit/vkeni has one plural, keni must be to do, and izamt must also be a form of to do; we then get that :sol[vkeni = I did], and because I did and you (pl.) did are both past tense, that :sol[kenit = you (pl.) did] and :sol[izamt = you (pl.) will do]. 

We now let :sol[vigoreb = I will roll], because it is the only Georgian word with a unique stem and with a `v-` prefix. 

It's now fairly obvious that :sol[ambob = you say], and that vtkvi/tkvi and itavmGdomareve/vitavmGdomareve are I said/you said and I presided/you presided; because to say is more common, we assume that it should be shorter, so we get the following as our solution:

:::table{.no1Count .no2Count .width-800 .center}
::tr[:td[ambob, vtkvi, tkvi] :td[you say, I said, you said]]
::tr[:td[kenit, vkeni, izamt] :td[you (pl.) did, I did, you (pl.) will do]]
::tr[:td[inadiret, nadirob, vinadire] :td[you (pl.) hunted, you hunt, I hunted]]
::tr[:td[itavmGdomareve, vitavmGdomareve] :td[I presided, you presided]]
::tr[:td[vsadilobt, visadileb] :td[we dine, I will dine]]
::tr[:td[vigoreb] :td[I will roll]]
::tr[:td[vivlit] :td[we will walk]]

Also note that the `-i-` suffix likely denotes future tense (with some exceptions involving the suffixes `-e`/`-ob`), while `-ob` denotes present tense, `-e` denotes past tense, and `-eb` denotes future.
