In 1994, the students of a middle-school math class in Kaktovik, Alaska noticed that Arabic numerals (that is,
the digits 0 to 9) were badly suited to counting in their language, Iñupiaq.[^1]
They decided to come up with a
new numeral system, one that would reflect the Iñupiaq number system.

The Kaktovik Iñupiaq numerals (as they have come to be known) made it much easier for students to do
math in Iñupiaq, and are easy to use and remember, since each symbol has an intuitive relationship with the
number it represents. Within a few years, schools and colleges across northern Alaska were using the
numerals, and they were recommended for use in Canada. If you walk into a math classroom in northern
Alaska today, you might well see a blackboard that looks like the one below, which features Kaktovik Iñupiaq
numerals, Iñupiaq words, and a few places intentionally left blank:

**D1.** Fill in the blanks a., b., and c. from the blackboard with Kaktovik Iñupiaq numerals. Remember to record
your answers on your Answer Sheet.

**D2.** Give the Iñupiaq word or words for:
a. three b. eleven c. twenty-two

**D3.** Write in Arabic numerals (i.e., using digits 0-9):
a. atausiq b. tallimat c. iñuiññaġutaiḷaq

**D4.** In the top left corner of the blackboard, the same thing is written twice: once in Kaktovik Iñupiaq
numerals, and once slightly differently in Iñupiaq words. Write in Arabic numerals (i.e., using digits 0-9):
a. the Kaktovik Iñupiaq numerals in the top left corner of the blackboard
b. quliagliaq

[^1]: Iñupiaq, meaning “real or genuine person” (iñuk = person, -piaq = real, genuine), is the language of the Iñupiaq people (or
Iñupiat). There are about 3000 speakers of the language, most of them living in northern Alaska. Iñupiaq is closely related to
several other Inuit languages spoken in Canada and Greenland.
