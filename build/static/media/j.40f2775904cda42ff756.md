Compiling a lexicon (a catalog of words) can be time-consuming and difficult because each individual word
has so many potential forms. Suppose that you are dealing with the following words:

:::div{.lmargin3}
view, viewed, viewing, views, review, reviewed, reviewing, reviews, watch, watched, watches,
watching, rewatch, rewatches, rewatching, rewatched, wave, waved, waves, waving, rewave, rewaves,
rewaved, and rewaving.
:::

Writing all of these forms is tedious; even though you generate a list, you will probably feel listless. Therefore, instead of using this brute force method, you can condense the list with the format shown below:

| `VERBPREFIX` | `VERBSTEM` | `VERBSUFFIX` |
| - | - | - |
| re | watch  | ed |
| Ø | view | s |
| | wave | ing |
| | | Ø|

This setup generates a list of all words that consist of one component of ``VERBPREFIX`` followed by one
component of `VERBSTEM` followed by one component of `VERBSUFFIX` (the Ø stands for an empty spot,
so a word could have no letters in the `VERBPREFIX` or `VERBSUFFIX` slot). The list generated is identical
to the brute force list but is much less tedious to create.

There is one major problem, however. The way that this format strings together word components (called
morphemes) does not account for spelling changes that may occur along the way. For example, many legitimate words are generated, such as watch, review, and rewaves, but some misspelled words also result, such
as watchs and waveing. In order to fix this, you also need to write a set of spelling change rules to describe
these changes. The applicable rules in this case are:

:::div{.lmargin3}
`ch -> che || * s`<br>
`e -> Ø || * [ed | ing]`
:::

These rules mean “ch turns into che if ch is followed by s” and “e turns into nothing if e is followed by ed or
ing.”

There are many different ways that this type of rule can be written. Here are a few more examples of such
rules and their meanings:

`u -> w || * Vowel` 
- (u turns into w if u is followed by a vowel)

`np -> mp` 
- (np always turns into mp) 

`t -> c || Consonant * kf` 
- (t turns into c if it is between a consonant and kf)

`[l | f | r] -> z || w * [c | p]` 
- (each letter l, f, or r will turn into z if it falls between w
and either c or p)

**J1.** Consider the following lexicon and set of rules. (Note that the rules apply in the order given).

| _ _ _ | _ _ _ | nsk -> jeej |
| | | gt -> e \|\| avr * |
| | | j -> res \|\| avb * |
| | | j -> tu \|\| b * |
| | | gt -> ar |

| | | q -> eu \|\| * ca |
| | | ay -> y \|\| * p |
| | | qc -> po |
| | | c -> m \|\| * av |
| | | vr -> pl |

**A.** Write the four words generated by the above lexicon and set of rules.

> 1. :ans 2. :ans 3. :ans 4. :ans

**B.** If you add two more three-letter entries to the lexicon (one entry in `PARTONE` and one entry in
`PARTTWO`), the system will generate an additional five words that go together with the four words from
Task 1. What are the new entries for `PARTONE` and `PARTTWO`?

> 1. :ans 2. :ans

What are the five newly generated words? (Hint: Every rule is used at least once.)

> 1. :ans 2. :ans 3. :ans 4. :ans 5. :ans

**J2.** The following lexicon and incomplete set of spelling change rules was designed to output a list of adjectival
forms of country names, as shown in the table on the next page. It works almost exactly as intended: the
output of the setup is identical to the “Desired Adjective” column (on the next page) except that it produces the wildly incorrect word “ottruese” in place of “australian.”

TASK: Fill in the blanks in the Spelling Change Rules (just write your answers directly in the blanks in the box
below). Each blank stands for a single letter. Remember that these rules will produce “ottruese” instead of
“australian” and that the rules apply in the order given.
