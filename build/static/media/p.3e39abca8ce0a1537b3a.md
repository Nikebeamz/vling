Nakanai (*Lakalai*) is a language spoken by around 13,000 people of the Nakanai tribe in West New Britain,
Papua New Guinea. Below are some words in Nakanai given along with their so-called “reduplicated form,” a
grammatical form which has a large number of different uses (e.g. plural verb marking, habituative mood[^1]
,
and collective plurals).

However, these uses are irrelevant to the derivation of the reduplicated form.

[^1]: A verbal feature denoting that the action takes place habitually; e.g. English “I usually go on walks”
