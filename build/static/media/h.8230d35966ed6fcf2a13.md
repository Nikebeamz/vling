In 1850, a farmer from a village in Cyprus discovered a tablet dating from the 5th century BCE, which recorded an endowment from the city of Idalion to a family of physicians. Now known as the Idalion Tablet, this
document was of enormous importance for the decipherment of the Cypriot script in which it was written.
The tablet is in the Cypriot dialect of ancient Greek.

Here is a portion of the inscription, with a transliteration below:
