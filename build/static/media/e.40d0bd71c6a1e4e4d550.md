The data in this problem are drawn from Ik, the native language of the Ik people who live on a narrow swath of land in the northeastern corner of Uganda, East Africa. (A map is provided on the next page.) The people call their language Icétôd, which means ‘Ik-speech’ or ‘Ik-talk’ and is pronounced ee-CHAY-TOad or [ītʃétôd] in phonetic symbols. Approximately 7,500 people are native speakers of Ik.

The Ik phrases and sentences in this problem are written in the commonly used orthography. Keep in mind
the following as you examine the data:
- The digraph *ts* and the trigraph *ts’* are used to represent two different consonant sounds in Ik.
- A diacritic borrowed from the International Phonetic Alphabet has been added to the data to reflect a
pronunciation feature relevant to the problem. The symbol is a small ring that appears below a letter.
This diacritic reflects that the sound represented orthographically is pronounced without the vocal folds
vibrating or, in less technical terms, is whispered by the native speakers of the language. Something
similar happens in English when native speakers pronounce words like *p**o**tato* [pʰ**ə̥**ˈtʰeɪɾ̯oʊ̯] and *p**e**culiar*
[pʰ**ə̥**ˈkjů ːliɚ] where the vowel in the first syllable becomes voiceless. To appreciate how this phonetic
process works, try saying the word *peculiar* or *potato* with a pause between the first and second syllable
of the word, and notice that your vocal folds do not begin vibrating until you pronounce the second
syllable of the word. In the case of English, the vowel in the first syllable of words with this phonological
structure is *devoiced*, which means it is pronounced without vocal fold vibration.
