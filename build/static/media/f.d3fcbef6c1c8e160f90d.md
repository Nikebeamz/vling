*Notes:*
*In this problem, an accent above a vowel (e.g., in “kété”) indicates that the vowel has high tone. Unmarked vowels have low tone.*
*A consonant or vowel written twice in a row (e.g., in “guurafis”) is pronounced for a longer time by the speaker. An apostrophe*
*following a consonant (e.g., in “s’anubim”) indicates that the consonant is pronounced ejectively (i.e., with air pressure produced in*
*the throat instead of the lungs).*

The six sentences below were uttered by a linguist who had been trying to learn Dime. Unfortunately, only
three of them were fully understood by native speakers; the other three were deemed incorrect, meaning
they contained mistakes or were not understood at all.

**F2.** For each of the following six sentences, choose from the options provided to convert it into a
grammatically correct Dime sentence. (Remember that three of the sentences are already grammatically
correct — for these three sentences, you should choose option W.) For every sentence, only one option will
successfully produce a grammatically correct sentence. Circle the correct option.

**F3.** Translate the corrected versions (or the original versions, for the sentences that were already correct) of
the following six sentences into English. Write your translation in the box below each set of options.
[^1]: Dime is an Afroasiatic language spoken in Ethiopia. Estimates of the number of speakers of Dime vary from a few hundred, on the low end, up to a few
thousand; all studies agree, however, that the number of speakers is decreasing, and the language is threatened with extinction. Dime speakers live in a
series of farming communities located along a mountain range and have relatively little contact with outside groups. The speakers are skilled metal
producers, with techniques for extracting and smelting ores forming an important part of their traditional cultural knowledge.
