from a common greeting, *jâm sǎy*, meaning “peace only.”

Note that the diacritics ´, `, ˇ, ˆ represent high, low, rising, and falling tones respectively. The symbol ∴ after a
word means that the word is pronounced with “dying-quail intonation,” an exaggerated prolongation of the
tone accompanied by an exaggerated drop in pitch.[^1]
The symbol : after a vowel signifies length, and :sup[n]
signifies nasalization of the previous sound.

[^1]: Jeffrey Heath, who studied Jamsay, writes: “The dying-quail intonation contour reminds me of the prosodic pattern of American
high-school cheerleaders calling out the letters of their school at sporting events, through their bullhorns (“give me an A…., give me
a B…”).”
