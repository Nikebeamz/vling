Dakelh, also called Carrier, is an Athabascan language spoken by approximately 1,000 people in British Columbia. Dakelh is written today with the Latin alphabet, but the first system of writing used to write it was similar to that used in some regions to write Cree and Inuktitut. However, due to having more sounds, Dakelh contains symbols that are not found in these other languages.


**C1:** Here are some words written in the syllabary. In the right column are the transcriptions of these same words in the Latin alphabet, but in random order. Match each word with the correct transcription.

**C2:** Here are two short stories published in a Dakelh newspaper in 1891:

Identify the following words in these excerpts:

::tr[:td[(p) Maurice] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(q) Marchal] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(r) Okanagan] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(s) Philomène] :td[:ans{.med}]]
::tr[:td[(t) Julia] :td[:ans{.med}]]

Note that the pronunciation of these names in Dakelh could be different from their pronunciation in French or in English.

**C3:** Write the following words in the Latin alphabet:

:::table{.border-hidden .width-800 .mb2 .no1Count .no2Count}
::tr[:td[u. ᑓᒡ] :td[Sandhill crane] :td[:ans{.med}]]

::tr[:td[y. ᘄᑊᗯᔆᘍᐉ] :td[wild cherry] :td[:ans{.med}]]

**Note:** Certain combinations of letters represent a single sound in Dakelh: **ts** (pronounced like in *tsé-tsé*), **ts'** (like a **ts** but with glottalization), **ch** (the tch in French), **dz** like the *zz* in *pizza*), **lh**
(a *l* without vibating the vocal cords), **wh** (a *w* without vibrating the vocal cords).

**TL note:** I forget which translation of `foyer` is correct; I translated it to `home` temporarily.
