Tamazight is a family of closely related languages spoken by tens of millions of people across North Africa.

Tamazight languages are official languages in Morocco (which is also called *Imeghrib* in Tamazight) and Algeria (in Tamazight, *Dzhayr* or *Lezzayer*).

Tamazight can be written using the Latin alphabet, but it also uses the Tifinagh script, which dates back more
than 2000 years, although it has been adapted for modern use. Tifinagh can be written left-to-right, right-toleft, or bottom-to-top, with the orientation of some of the symbols altered accordingly. In this problem, all
words are written left-to-right.

On the next page is a list of place names in Tamazight, written in the Tifinagh script, on the left, and the same
places named in English on the right, in a scrambled order. Note that the Tamazight names and the English
names are not always exactly the same as each other (even after converting from one alphabet to the other).
For two of the places, the names are really quite different.

**K1.** Match up the Tamazight names with their English equivalents.
