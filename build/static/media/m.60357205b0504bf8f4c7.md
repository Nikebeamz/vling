Tawala is an Oceanic language spoken in Papua New Guinea by 20,000 people who live in small villages on
the East Cape peninsula.

Below and on the next page are some Tawala sentences and their translations. Note that *you(sg)* means “you
(referring to one person),” and *you(pl)* means “you (referring to more than one person).” Also note that some
of the Tawala words feature *reduplication*, which is a linguistic process in which all or a part of a word is
repeated. For this problem, you will not need to figure out *how* a reduplicated form is produced from a nonreduplicated form, but you should pay attention to *when* a reduplicated form is used and when a nonreduplicated form is used.

1) **Aem daodaohi ega witewiteihi.**
<br>*Your(sg) long legs are never difficult.*
2) **Ogaleya ma ega igalemi babana itowotowolo.**
<br>*You(pl) see him but he does not see you(pl) because he is standing.*
3) **Apo onanae babana odaladala.**

**M4.** As noted in the introduction to this problem, reduplication is a linguistic process in which all or part of a
word is repeated. Describe when reduplication is used in Tawala. You do not need to describe how the
reduplicated form of a word is created; you only need to describe when reduplicated forms are used.
