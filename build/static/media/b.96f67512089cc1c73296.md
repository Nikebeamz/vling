title: Junk Mail—Letters We Don’t Need
points: 10
---

Recently, a group of researchers decided that the alphabet had too many letters. The letters could not fit
conveniently on cell phone keyboards, there were too many options when filling in crosswords, and children
were wasting time chanting all 26 letters in the alphabet song. Luckily, the researchers noticed that
many letters were unnecessary. For example, *p* and *b* sound a lot alike, so they decided to replace every *p*
with a *b* (while every *b* remained unchanged). For example, *plug* would be rewritten *blug*, but *bug* would
stay written as *bug*. They continued this process until they narrowed down the alphabet to just 9 letters. This
writing system was named “Duw Ulbubud,” and the media went wild. Here is one of the headlines that ran
that day:

WURDZ WULL BU ZBULLUD DUVVURUDDLU
<br>BUGUUZU UV “DUW ULBUBUD”

The article ended with the following words:

<br>ruddub luddurz. Wu zuzd uvu udu buzur gwuuzduud: uz ud zuzduvuud? Ugzbugd ludz uv gubbluuddz

**B1.** Rewrite each of the following words in Duw Ulbubud:

::tr[:td[fifth:] :td[:ans] :td[squeaky:] :td[:ans]]
::tr[:td[jazz:] :td[:ans] :td[bagpipes:] :td[:ans]]
::tr[:td[vertex:] :td[:ans] :td[calming:] :td[:ans]]
:::

**B2.** One major problem with Duw Ulbubud is ambiguity. For example, after Duw Ulbubud was adopted,
many people grew up assuming that the book *Moby Dick* was about a young bird. How is *Moby Dick* written
in Duw Ulbubud? What were people mistakenly interpreting this Duw Ulbubud title to mean?

::tr[:td[Title in Duw Ulbubud:] :td[:ans{cl=sm}] :td[Misinterpretation:] :td[:ans{cl=sm}]]
:::

**B3.** TV shows began to use Duw Ulbubud’s ambiguity as a source of humor. In one show, the main character
texted two friends a message that was intended to say, “Give me a minute.” But then one friend handed her
a fruit, and the other handed her a vegetable. What was the fruit? What was the vegetable?

**B4.** Although the writing system was initially called Duw Ulbubud, people quickly
shifted to a new name, *Zduvvu-Duzu Dulg*, a name based on how the words sound when read aloud. What
does *Zduvvu-Duzu Dulg* translate to?
