The Chinese language was first spoken in a small area in Henan, China, around 1000 BCE, during the Zhou
Dynasty. However, by the time of the Tang Dynasty (700 CE), many words had changed significantly. For example, the sound -aj lost its final -j. Below is a table of some words in Chinese, according to a recent historical reconstruction of the language. Each word has two pronunciations: those of the Zhou era (Old Chinese)
and those of the Tang era (Middle Chinese). (A pronunciation guide is provided on the final page.) However,
some pronunciations in the table are missing.

- The letter ˤ after a consonant marks pharyngealization of the preceding consonant (constriction of the
 throat).
- j is pronounced like y in English yes.
- ʔ is the so-called glottal stop (the sound between the two syllables of uh-oh).
- ǝ is the vowel of English cut.
- ŋ is the final sound of English hang.
- The symbols ¯, ´, ` and ˜ mark tones.
