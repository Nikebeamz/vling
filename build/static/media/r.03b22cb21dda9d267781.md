One common task in developing technologies for human languages is grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (or
G2P).[^1]
In G2P, you convert words written in orthography (the practical writing systems that people use day-to-day) to a standardized phonetic transcription that can be used for recognizing and synthesizing speech,
among other things. In this problem, you will help develop G2P for Carib (Karìnja), a Cariban language
spoken by about 7,400 Carib people in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Brazil. Below are
some words in Carib with their pronunciations and meanings (a guide to the phonetic symbols is provided on
the next page). Here are some words to get you started:

| Word (orthography) | Phonetic transcription | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| aikuma | /ˈaih.kʲu.ma/ | to make something juicy |
| yrama | /ˈɽa.ma/ | I am turned |
| asaperary | /a.ˈsaʔ.pe.ˈɾa.ɽa/ | your cup |
| õkaikõ | /ˈoŋ.gai.gʲõ/ | combs |
| taweipore | /ta.ˈweih.pʲo.ɽe/ | well-lit |
| saraisarai | /sa.ˈɽai.ʃʲa.ɽai/ | the sound of raking |

| sukurusaniry | /su.ˈgu.ɽu.ˈsa.ni.ɾi/ | of the candy |
| Sipanijorory | /ʃi.ˈbʲa.ni.ˈjʲo.ɽo.ɽo/ | of the Spaniard |
| yjenarĩkepy | /ˈje.na.ˈɽiŋ.gʲe.bɨ/ | I stop being afraid |
| sikirìma | /ʃi.ˈgʲi.ɾiʔ.mʲa/ | to divide into pieces |
| pẽputu | /ˈpem.bu.du/ | dung beetle |

| enaro | /e.ˈna.ɽo/ | governor |
| ytuwarõ | /ˈtu.wa.ɽõ/ | I am forgotten |
| pirai | /ˈpi.ɾai/ | piranha |
| uwẽposapariky | /u.ˈwem.bo.ˈsaʔ.pa.ˈɽiʔ.kʲɨ/ | puffiness of the belly |
| mòwusa | /ˈmoʔ.wu.sa/ | to sharpen |
| jarã | /ˈja.ɽã/ | fence |

As you can see, some consonants in the phonetic transcription of Carib are different from those of
English. To help you understand how these consonants are pronounced, here is some information on their
location in the mouth and manner of articulation (ɽ is pronounced farther back in the mouth than ɾ).
“Voiced” and “voiceless” indicate that the vocal cords vibrate and don’t vibrate, respectively, during
pronunciation. Note also that j
after a consonant represents palatalization, or softer articulation, and ˈ before
a syllable indicates that it is stressed (i.e., pronounced more emphatically, like the first syllable of the
geographical feature “desert”, or the second syllable of the food “dessert”). The boundary between syllables
is marked with a period.

| | | Labial (lips) |Coronal (tip of tongue against roof of mouth) | Palatal (middle of tongue against hard palate) | Velar (back of tongue against soft palate)| Glottal (vocal cords) |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Nasal | Voiced | m | n | | ŋ | |
| Stop | Voiceless | p | t | | k | ʔ |
| Stop | Voiced | b | d | | g | |
| Fricative | Voiceless | | s | ʃ | | h |
| Liquid | Voiced | | ɾ, ɽ | j | w | |

**R1.** On your Answer Sheet, fill in the following table to provide rules for the pronunciation of orthographic *y*.
Note that for each answer you provide in the “Phoneme” column (i.e., answers **(c)**, **(e)**, **(g)**, and **(h)**), you
should answer with a single phoneme (i.e., a single character used in the phonetic transcriptions). Multiple
correct answers are possible.

| Grapheme | Environment | | Phoneme |
| - | - | - | - |
| if *y* | **(a)** :ans | it is silent | — |
| but if *y* | **(b)** :ans | it is pronounced as | **(c)** :ans |
| but if *y* | **(d)** :ans | it is pronounced as | **(e)** :ans |
| but if *y* | **(f)** :ans | it is pronounced as | **(g)** :ans |
| otherwise | — | *y* is pronounced as | **(h)** :ans |


**R2.** On your Answer Sheet, fill in the following table to provide rules for the pronunciation of orthographic *p*,
*t*, and *k*. For this question, you should ignore palatalization (none of your answers in the “Phonemes” column
should include the $^j$
symbol).

Note that for each entry you fill in the “Phonemes” column (i.e., **(c)**, **(e)**, and **(f)**), you should provide three
answers of one or more phonemes each, and you should order your answers respectively, separated by
commas (i.e., with the pronunciation of p first, then t, then k). Multiple correct answers are possible.

| Grapheme | Environment | | Phonemes |
| - | - | - | - |
| if *p*, *t*, or *k* | (a) :ans | they are pronounced as | h.p, h.t, h.k respectively |
| but if *p*, *t*, or *k* | (b) :ans | they are pronounced as | (c) :ans, respectively |
| but if *p*, *t*, or *k* | (d) :ans | they are pronounced as | (e) :ans, respectively |
| otherwise | — | they are pronounced as | (f) :ans, respectively |

**R3.** On your Answer Sheet, fill in the blanks in the following table, using the G2P rules you developed based
on the data (including, but not limited to, the rules from R1 and R2).

| Word (orthography) | Phonetic transcription | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| makopamy | (a) :ans | to grow dark |
| aitopòma | (b) :ans | homeless |
| kerikeri | (c) :ans | a species of bird |
| parimy | (d) :ans | son in law of |
| kurijara | (e) :ans | boat |
| ykurijarary | (f) :ans | my boat |
| tykupimy | (g) :ans | what needs to be bathed |

**R4.** On your Answer Sheet, explain the G2P rules you developed for Carib based on the data. You do not
need to repeat your rules from **R1** and **R2**.

problem, and vice versa.
