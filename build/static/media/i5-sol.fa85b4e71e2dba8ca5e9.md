This problem is fairly easy; we simply need to match sounds. Note that a common pitfall might be mapping Proto-Chamic -> Phan Rang Cham -> Tsat; there is no need to do this. 

We examine Phan Rang Cham first, and Tsat later.

We can break up each combination of letters (consonant -> vowel -> [optional final consonant]) by syllables, denoting vowels by V and consonants by C. Comparing between the lists, we get the following patterns. 

General patterns:
- b -> p
- d -> t
- j -> c
- g -> k
- mV -> mɨ
- V: -> V

First syllable:
- ʔV -> V
- l? -> li (from *lima, *lanah, *dua lapan, *labaːt)
- bV[h]\(r/l) -> pi (from *bara, *bulow) (note that it helps to know that r/l are similar or indistinguishable in many languages)
- if the above rules don't apply, CV -> Ca

Last syllable:
- s -> th
- (p/t/k) -> ʔ
