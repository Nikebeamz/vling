Ge'ez is a writing system used in a set of languages spoken in the Horn of Africa, the main ones being Amharic and Tigrigna. In Ge'ez, as in Latin and Greek classic, letters are also used to write numbers.

Here are some accounts where the numbers have been replaced by their Ge'ez equivalents (the symbols +, −, × and = are not used in Ge'ez).

:::table{.border-hidden .padding-none .width-400 .center .mb2}
::tr[:td[a. ፻ × ፭ = ፭፻]]
::tr[:td[b. ፭ × ፲ = ፶]]
::tr[:td[c. ፶ + ፶ = ፻]]
::tr[:td[d. ፲ × ፲ = ፻]]
::tr[:td[e. ፻ + ፶ = ፻፶]]
::tr[:td[f. ፲ + ፲ = ፳]]
::tr[:td[g. ፻፭ + ፳ = ፻፳፭]]
:::

**E1:** The greatest value in these expressions is 500. Find the value that corresponds to each expression (only the total on each side of the equal symbol). 

:::table{.border-hidden .padding-none .width-800 .no1Count .no2Count .mb2}
::tr[:td[a.] :td[:ans] :td[e.] :td[:ans]]
::tr[:td[b.] :td[:ans] :td[f.] :td[:ans]]
::tr[:td[c.] :td[:ans] :td[g.] :td[:ans]]
::tr[:td[d.] :td[:ans] :td[] :td[]]
:::

**E2:** Give the missing values (in digits) in the following expressions:

:::table{.border-hidden .padding-none .width-800 .center .no1Count .no2Count .mb2}
::tr[:td[፲ − ፭ = **(h)** :ans] :td[፶ × **(i)** :ans = ፭፻]]
::tr[:td[**(j)** :ans + ፲ = ፲፭] :td[፭ × **(k)** :ans = ፻፳፭]]
:::

**Note:** In order to correctly represent in Ge'ez the quantities which are represented by more than one character, it is necessary connect the horizontal lines above and below each character that composes them, like in Roman numerals. However, due to typographical limitations, these lines are not connected in most printed works.
