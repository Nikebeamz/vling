Consider fourteen Latin words and their English translations:
| Latin | English | Latin | English
| - | - | - | - |
| barba | "beard" | vidua | "widow" |
| dīvidit | "he divides" | mordāx | "biting" |
| fūmus | "smoke" | glabra | "hairless" |
| fracēs | "sediment" | falx | "sickle" |
| fovēre | "to heat" | rubrīca | "red paint" |
| mandere | "to chew" | mediocris | "moderate" |
| verbum | "word" | fingo | "I  sculpt" |

Linguists believe that in ancient times all these words except one contained the *dh* sound (*d*
pronounced with an aspiration). Later, *dh* was replaced by other sounds.

Consider the four English words cognate to four of the Latin words given above: 
- beard
- widow
- word
- red

**Assignment 1.** Indicate the Latin word of the above list that never contained the *dh* sound.
Explain your solution.

**Assignment 2.** Consider six more Latin words:

| Latin | English | Latin | English |
| - | - | - | - |
| brevis | "short" | gurdus | "silly" |
| frīgus | "cold" | unda | "wave" |
| combrētum | "reed" | dēbeo | "I owe" |

Which of these words are sure to have never contained the *dh* sound? Why?

**Note.** Latin *x* is pronounced like English *x* as in *ox*; the dash over vowels indicates that
they are long.
