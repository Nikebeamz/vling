In Lithuanian[^1] nouns the accent may move according to the number and the case of the nouns, i.e., different syllables may be accented in different forms of the same word. The pattern of accent movement is called the :u[accent paradigm] of the nou. 

There are two types of syllables in Lithuanian. If a syllable of the first type is accented, that syllable has :u[falling] intonation marked **'**, e.g.: *íe, ó, ál*. If a syllable of the second type is accented, that syllable has :u[rising] intonation marked **~**, e.g.: *an᷈, õ, ie᷈*.

Within the same root or the same ending, the syllable type always remains the same. For example, the root *liep*, when accented, always has falling intonation, whereas the ending of the Nominative Plural *os* always has rising intonation. 

The following examples illustrate the four main types of Lithuanian accent paradigms (they look somewhat different in modern Lithuanian, but this is irrelevant for the problem):

In the late 19th century, the great Swiss linguist Ferdinand se Saussure studied the ancient paradigms of Lithuanian nouns and came to the conclusion that at an earlier stage of the development of Lithuanian there were not four, but only :u[two] accent paradigms. Later, as a result of a specific rule, which is now known as Saussure's Law, the accent moved under certain conditions, and each paradigm split in two.

**Assignment 1.** Determine which accent pardigms originally belonged together.

**Assignment 2.** Determine what the initial accent paradigms looked like.

**Assignment 3.** Formulate Saussure's Law.

**Note.** **ž** is a specific Lithuanian consonant, **N** shows a specifical (nasal) pronunciation of the preceding vowel.

[^1]: The *Lithuanian* language is of the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken by 3 million people in Lithuania and some other countries.
