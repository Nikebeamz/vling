Before we start, a key concept to this problem is [*collectivity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun), which takes the form of a suffix in English (-age and -ade), a prefix in German (ge-), a circumfix in Dutch (ge- -te), and an infix in Esperanto (-ar-).

At first glance, for Zuni, we have two words with a "repeat" word—`mo:chikwa datda:we` and `mo:chikwa mulo:chikwa`, and `doko:ko mo'le` and `doko:ko shiwe`. In English, we have two obvious pairs: `chicken meat` and `chicken egg`, as well as `peach pie` and `peach trees`. Slightly more tangentially, we think `beads` may or may not be related to `chicken egg`, `sugar` related to `chocolate bar` and `peach pie`, `tea` related to `piles of leaves` (which may be related to `peach trees`), and `loaf of bread` may be related to `chocolate bar`.

Which goes with which? We see two words similar to `mo:chikwa` elsewhere in the list: `ma:chikwa` (4) and `mu:chikwa` (5). Meaning, there are two words that are similar to `mo:chikwa`; on the English side of things, more words seem similar to `peach` than `chicken`. Hence,
- {doko\:ko mo'le, doko\:ko shiwe} = {chicken meat, chicken egg}
- {mo\:chikwa datda\:we, mo\:chikwa mulo\:chikwa} = {peach pie, peach tree}

We wonder which one is which—`doko:ko mo'le` seems like it could mean `chicken egg` if we assume that `mulonne = mu'le` roughly means beads; we'll have to check this later. On the other hand, there exists a second `-:chikwa` word in `mo:chikwa mulo:chikwa`. We guess that it then means something related to sugar *or* something related to plants. Examine the following groups:

| Zuni 1 | Zuni 2 | English 1 | English 2 |
| - | - | - | -| 
| mo\:chikwa datda\:we | mo\:chikwa mulo\:chikwa | peach trees | peach pie |
| haya\:we | ma\:chikwa | pile of leaves | sugar |
| ha\:k'yawe | mu\:chikwa | tea (drink) | chocolate bar |
| | mu'le | | loaf of bread |

(Note that I personally think the stumbling block here is realizing that `datda:we` and `haya:we` are related and that `mu\:chikwa` and `mu'le` are related—specifically, that `:` and `'` separate thoughts and aren't just letters.)

It's a fairly direct jump down columns, and so we can just pair Zuni 1 with English 1 and Zuni 2 and English 2. Note that we put `ma:chikwa` before `mu:chikwa` because `mu:chikwa` is connected to `mu'le`.

I also realize *after* solving that `mulonne` and `mulo:chikwa` are related, and indeed `mo'le` and `mowe` are related.

This yields the following solution for **(a)**:
:::sol
1. **mo\:chikwa datda\:we** — *I. peach trees*
2. **haya\:we** — *G. lit. piles of leaves (actually planted fields [fields of plants])*
3. **doko\:ko mo’le** — *H. chicken egg*
4. **ma\:chikwa** — *C. sugar*
5. **mu\:chikwa** — *J. chocolate bar*
6. **mulonne, mu’le** — *D. loaf of bread*
7. **mowe** — *E. beads*
8. **ha\:k’yawe** — *B. tea*
9. **doko\:ko shiwe** — *A. chicken meat*
10. **mo\:chikwa mulo\:chikwa** — *F. peach pie*
:::

Examining the table in **(b)**, we note a few things: in Zuni, similar words are {`ada muwe`, `ada k'yawe`}, {`homa:we, homayanne`}, {`ma:k'yawe`, `ma:k'ose`, `ma'le`}, {`ma:k'yawe`, `ade k'yawe`}, {`ma'le`, `mi'le`}, and {`beyanne`, `homayanne`}. For English, we have {`salt`, `salt water`, `granule/grain`}, {`juniper leaves`, `juniper branch`}, and {`blood, blood clots`}, most obviously. 

This leads us to suspect that `ma` means `granule/grain`, which makes sense with `ma:chikwa` from part **(a)**. Because `ha:k'yawe` means water, we guess that `ma:k'yawe` means salt water, so `ma:k'ose` means salt. This implies that `k'yawe` means water/liquid, so we guess that `ade k'yawe` means blood, and `ade muwe` means blood clots. 

Remaining, we have `beyanne`, `homa:we`, `homayanne`, and `mi'le`, and for English, `ear of corn`, `juniper leaves`, `juniper branch`, and `field of grass`. We recall from part **(a)** that `haya:we` meant pile of leaves, which suggests that `homa:we` means `juniper leaves`, hence `homayanne` means juniper branch. But then how do we distinguish between `beyanne` and `mi'le`, or `ear of corn` and `field of grass`?

We examine words with the following suffixes:

| -le | -yanne | -nne| -we | 
| - | - | - | - |
| doko\:ko mo'le (chicken egg) | homayanne (juniper branch) | homayanne (juniper branch) |  mo\:chikwa datda\:we (peach trees) |
| mu'le (loaf of bread) | beyanne (???) | beyanne (???) | haya\:we (piles of leaves) |
| ma'le (granule) | | mulonne (loaf of bread) | mowe (beads) |
| mi'le (???) | | | doko\:ko shiwe (chicken meat) |
| | | | ade muwe (blood clots) |
| | | | homa\:we (juniper leaves) |

It seems that `-le` and `-nne` indicate the same thing, and that `-ya-` is an extra suffix that we should consider. Specifically, for `-ya-` we have an additional `haya:we`, piles of leaves. `-we` seems to indicate plurality (apparently, water and meat are plural). Hence, `-le/-nne` indicate that the word is singular. We use `-le` when the preceding part of the word has one syllable and `-nne` when it has two. Similarly, we use `-we` and `-:we`.

`-ya-` is then an infix denoting collectivity. (Note: this takes some intuition to get.) Hence, `beyanne` means field of grass, so we get the following solution for **(b)**: 

:::sol
11. **ade muwe** — *O. blood clots*
12. **beyanne** — *P. field of grass*
13. **homa\:we** — *M. juniper leaves*
14. **ma\:k’yawe** — *N. salt water*
15. **ma\:k’ose** — *S. salt*
16. **ma’le** — *K. granule, grain*
17. **homayanne** — *R. juniper branch*
18. **mi’le** — *L. ear of corn [corn cob]*
19. **ade k’yawe** — *Q. blood*
:::


For **(c)**, following the derived rules above, we get:

:::sol
20. **be’le** — *blade of grass* (a singular of beyanne, field of grass)
21. **chikwa** — *sweet*
22. **datdanne** — *tree* (a plural of mo\:chikwa datda\:we, peach trees, if mo\:chikwa is peach)
23. **ade** — *blood* (from ada k'yawe, blood)
24. **mulo\:we** — *loaves of bread* (a plural of mulonne, loaf of bread)
25. **hawe** — *leaves* (a plural of leaf from haya\:we, piles of leaves, and ha\:k'yawe, tea or leaf water)
:::

For **(d)**, we get:

:::sol
26. **salty** — *k'ose* (from ma\:k'ose, salt, since ma means granule and sugar is ma\:chikwa, or sweet granule) 
27. **juniper leaf** — *homanne* (singular of homa\:we, juniper leaves)  
28. **piece of meat** — *shi'le*  (singular of doko\:ko shiwe, chicken meat, if doko\:ko means chicken)
29. **water** — *k'yawe*  
30. **corn, maize** — *miwe* (a plural of mi'le, ear of corn)  
31. **fields of grass** — *beya:we* (a pural of beyanne, field of grass) 
:::

For **(e)**, Ma'k'yayanne directly means a singular collective of salt water, or a :sol[salt lake]. 

In general, I think the hardest part of this problem is splitting up words, aka realizing the existence of 
1. `:` and `'` split words
2. prefixes/infixes/circumfixes/suffixes exist! pay attention to repeated sequences of letters (and consider that they likely indicate gender, tense, possession, plurality, collectivity etc)

This explanation is a bit rough because I don't think I'd get this in contest. If you'd like to rewrite or add to it, feel free. Some pairings are a bit BS (ex. in **(a)**, connecting mo\:chikwa datda\:we with haya\:we by justifying \:we as meaning something along the lines of tree/plant).
