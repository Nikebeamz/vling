The Yanomamö are a group of 35,000 indigenous people living in the Amazon Rainforest of South America.
Below is a family tree of a Yanomamö family; a triangle denotes a male family member, whereas a circle denotes a female family member (in case you are unfamiliar with family trees, see the end of the problem for
further notes on reading them).

A visitor has asked five of the seven children to briefly introduce their brothers, sisters, and cousins. The children’s responses are below. Based on these responses, you will need to give the name of the child who corresponds to each numbered position in the family tree; note that we have already provided one match for you
(Krihisiwa is 7 in the tree). You may assume that the children labeled 1 through 7 are the only ones in their
generation in this family, and you may also assume that any numbers in the children’s responses are exact
(e.g., “I have two *soriwa*” means “I have exactly two *soriwa*”).

**Response from Davi:**
<br>I have one *suaboya*: Okori
<br>I have two *soriwa*: Rerebawa and Krihisiwa
<br>I have two *amiwa*: Yarima and Bushika

**Response from Bushika:**
<br>I have two *eiwa*: Mukashe and Davi
<br>I have one *amiwa*: Yarima
<br>I have two *soriwa*: Rerebawa and Krihisiwa

**Response from Rerebawa:**
<br>I have two *suaboya*: Yarima and Bushika
<br>I have two *soriwa*: Mukashe and Davi

**Response from Mukashe:**
<br>I have one *soriwa*: Rerebawa
<br>I have no *suaboya*
<br>I have two *amiwa*: Yarima and Bushika
**Response from Krihisiwa:**
<br>I have one *amiwa*: Okori
<br>I have one *suaboya*: Bushika
<br>I have one *soriwa*: Davi

Note: For simplicity, we have used the singular form of all Yanomamö terms, even when those terms are referring to more than one person.

*Example family tree:* In case you are unfamiliar with family trees, below is an example. B, C, & D are siblings;
so are E & F, and I & J. A & B are married, as are F & G and J & K. The parents of E & F are A & B. Similarly, the
parents of I & J are F & G, and E is the father of H. To give a few examples of more distant relationships: A is
the grandmother of H, I, & J; F is the aunt of H; and C is the sister-in-law of A.
