Hawu[^1]
(with around 110,000 speakers in 5 dialects) and Dhao[^2]
(with around 5000 speakers) are spoken on
three islands in the southernmost province of Indonesia. Similarities between the vocabularies of Hawu and
Dhao have led some writers to conclude that Dhao should be classified as another dialect of Hawu. For example, here are some related words in Hawu and Dhao (with one cell intentionally left blank):


| Hawu | Dhao | English |
|-|-|-|
| hupa | subha | swear an oath |
| puru | puru | descend |
| d’ue | dua | two |
| b’èhi | bèsi | iron, steel |
| d’ida | dedha | above |
| pedutu | | follow |
| ana telora | ana talora | middle child |
| bèj’i | bhèj’i | sleep |
| pepuru | papuru | lower (something) |
| do | dhu | relativizer “which” |


Below on the left are twelve sentences, six in Hawu and six in Dhao. The Hawu and Dhao sentences are
mixed together. On the right are their English translations in an arbitrary order. Each English translation corresponds to one sentence in Hawu and one sentence in Dhao.

[^1]: Until conversions in the 1970s, most Hawu people maintained their traditional religion and ways of life. The Hawu people remember genealogies spanning hundreds of years that preserve Hawu history and structure Hawu society.
[^2]: The Dhao people recount that their island was first settled by people from the island of Hawu. The Hawu also tell a version of this
history. Traditionally, Dhao women are weavers, while Dhao men are gold- and silver-smiths.

**L1.** For each sentence (1-12), indicate whether it is in Hawu or in Dhao by circling the correct option. Then
match it to the corresponding English translation by writing the correct letter in the box.

:match{num=12}

**L2.** Translate the following sentences (from Hawu or Dhao as appropriate) into English:

:::table{.border-hidden .no1Count .no2Count .width-800}
::tr[:td[a. Ra pasanède ina.] :td[:ans{cl=med}]]
::tr[:td[b. Ki ta pedutu ke roo ri ina noo, ta ngède ke noo ri roo.] :td[:ans{cl=med}]]
::tr[:td[c. Pehewina roo ri noo.] :td[:ans{cl=med}]]
::tr[:td[d. Ladhe na puru, na ladhe sebhe.] :td[:ans{cl=med}]]
::tr[:td[e. B’ole bèj’i.] :td[:ans{cl=med}]]
:::

**L3.** Translate into Hawu and into Dhao:

:::div{.lmargin2}
**a.** Don’t walk to the sea.
<br>Hawu: :ans{cl=med}
<br>Dhao: :ans{cl=med}

**b.** They keep seeing their mother.
<br>Hawu: :ans{cl=med}
<br>Dhao: :ans{cl=med}

**c.** She spilled the water.
<br>Hawu: :ans{cl=med}
<br>Dhao: :ans{cl=med}
::::

**L4.** In the table of Hawu and Dhao words at the beginning of the problem, the Dhao word related to the
Hawu word **pedutu** was left blank. Fill in the blank with the related Dhao word. (Hint: it appears somewhere
in this problem!)

:::table{.border-hidden .no1Count .no2Count .width-800}
::tr[:td[Dhao relative of **pedutu**:] :td[:ans{cl=med}]]
:::

**L5.** Dialects of a language tend to be largely mutually intelligible — that is, speakers of two dialects can understand each other without much effort. Based on the features of Hawu and Dhao that you have observed,
are Hawu and Dhao mutually intelligible? Answer in three sentences or less.
