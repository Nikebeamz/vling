[^1]: Sauk is an Algonquian language spoken in Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Like many Indigenous languages of North America, Sauk was negatively
impacted by European colonization and is now at risk of extinction. Today, Sauk is spoken by several hundred people; of these people, only a
handful speak Sauk monolingually (i.e., as their only language). However, recent revitalization efforts, including courses on Sauk offered in
schools, may help slow or reverse its decline.
[^2]: A foal is a young horse. Oklahoma City is Oklahoma’s capital and largest city.
