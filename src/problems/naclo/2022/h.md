Tseltal is a Mayan language spoken by about 590,000 people in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Below are
some Tseltal sentences about what people ate, along with their loose English translations. *Sg.* and *pl.* are
short for singular and plural.

*Note:* A :u[chicken comb] is the crest on top of a chicken’s head. A :u[gizzard] is an organ that birds use for grinding
up food. A :u[tamale] is a traditional Mesoamerican dish, made of dough that is steamed in a corn husk or
banana leaf. An :u[avocado] is a fruit that has a large seed and green flesh with green to purple or black skin. As
an avocado ripens, it becomes significantly softer; unlike other fruits, however, it does not become sweet.
:u[Panela] is a block of unprocessed brown sugar. A :u[tortilla] is a thin, circular flatbread usually made from corn
rather than wheat, as many other breads are. A :u[radish] is a crunchy vegetable with a sharp flavor often used
in salads. :u[Marrow] is a fatty substance contained in bones, sometimes spread over bread or vegetables.
:u[Greens] refers to green leafy vegetables that cook down into a mushy mass.
