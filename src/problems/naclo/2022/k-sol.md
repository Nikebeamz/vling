What stands out first is the amount of repetition in thisâ€”particularly, in Wik-Mungkan, the only "unique" words (aka they only appear once) are `puk pi'an` and `kiith`. 

Looking at the English translations, a few things stand out:
- **water** (W), undrinkable **water** (V), spring (**water** source) (Q), fresh **water** (H)
- **crab** (C), **crab** shell (D)
- body words: eye (F), fingernail (G), handcuffs (J), heart (L), shoulder blade (O), thumb (S); particularly, fingernail and thumb are likely to be related
- adjectives: brave (B), good (I), happy (K), sad (N), strong/firm (R), tired (T), trustworthy (e.g., with belongings) (U)
- awake (A), sound asleep (P), tired (T)
- law-related: handcuffs (J), law (M), trustworthy (e.g., with belongings) (U)

We look first at **water** and **crab** because they're likely to be one-word phrases in Wik-Mungkan, i.e. they need to be in the set {`mee'`(4), `min` (3), `ngak` (4), `ngangk` (5), `puuy` (3), `thayan` (6)}. (The number in parentheses is the number of phrases it occurs in.)

None of these occur exactly twice, so there must be at least one other word related to `crab`: the only possible candidates are `handcuffs` or `shoulder blade`, so we suspect handcuffs (because fingernail and shoulder blade appear more closely related, and we assume fingernail is more similar to `shell` than `crab`). For now, we assume that the first word is "primary" and the second word is a "modifier" i.e. less important.

Easily, we find that :sol[`puuy = crab`] and so :sol[`puuy ek = crab shell`]; this implies that `ek = shell`, so `fingernail` should be either `ngangk ek` or `ma' ek`. We let :sol[`ma' puuy = handcuffs`], so we guess that `ma' = hand`, so :sol[`ma' ek = fingernail`] \(lit. hand shell) and :sol[`ngangk ek = shoulder blade`]. `ngangk` is then related to some sort of body part, of which we have `eye`, `heart`, and `thumb` remaining. `thumb` is either `ma' puk pi' an` or `ma' thayan`. 

We then move onto water. It appears that we need to find a word that occurs as a primary word (i.e. first in the phrase) four times, which ultimately leaves us only with :sol[`ngak = water`]. Hence, {`ngak mee'`, `ngak min`, `ngak way`} = {`fresh water`, `spring (water source)`, `undrinkable water`}. 

The words we have yet to account for are `mee'` (3 primary, 1 modified), `min` (1 primary, 2 modified), `ngank` (5 primary, related to the body), and `thayan` (1 primary, 5 modified). We suspect that the words that modify more phrases are more likely to be adjectives (i.e. good/bad), and qualities are more fundamental than emotions. Hence, `mee'` is likely a noun, `min'` a quality (adjective), `ngank` a noun, and `thayan` a quality (adjective). 

For qualities and emotions, we have, respectively:
- qualities: brave (B) (likely NOT a word on its own), good (I), strong/firm (R), trustworthy (U) (likely NOT a word on its own)
- emotions: happy (K), sad (N)

We note that there are no negative qualities, yet `undrinkable water (V)` should be `water + a negative quality`. Indeed, peeking at **K2**, we're asked to translate *bad* despite it never appearing on the left hand side, so we suspect that :sol[`way = bad`]. Hence, :sol[`ngak way = undrinkable water`]. Examining `ngak mee'` and `ngak min`, we have that `mee'` is likely a noun and `min` is likely a quality, so we suspect that :sol[`ngak min = fresh water`] and :sol[`mgak mee' = spring (water source)`]. Because `way = bad`, then it is likely that :sol[`min = good`] rather than strong/firm, brave, or trustworthy because it is the direct opposite.

What is `mee'`, then? Our first instinct might be `heart` (to let spring (water source) = (lit.) water heart), but we suspect that `heart` is in the `ngangk` line. In fact, we suspect the following:
- brave = heart strong/firm
- happy = heart good
- sad = heart bad

... which lines up if we suppose :sol[`ngangk = heart`], because then :sol[`ngangk min = happy`] \(lit. heart good) and :sol[`ngangk way = sad`] \(lit. heart bad). Then, :sol[`ngangk thayan = brave`] \(lit. heart strong/firm), so :sol[`thayan = strong/firm`]. 

Our remaining words are then:
- ma' puk pi'an = hand ???
- ma' thayan = hand strong/firm
- mee' = (related to spring)
- mee' thayan = (related to spring) strong/firm
- mee' weep = (related to spring) ???
- weep thayan = ??? strong/firm
- wik kiith = ??? ???
- wik thayan = ??? strong/firm

and
- awake (A)
- English language (E)
- eye (F)
- law (M)
- sound asleep (P)
- thumb (S)
- tired (T)
- trustworthy (e.g. with belongings) (U)

We suspect that eye (F), awake (A), sound asleep (P), and tired (T) are related, and that `sound asleep` includes `thayan` as a modifier (versus just `asleep`). (Alternatively, sound asleep could literally be eye closed.) The noun is then likely :sol[`mee' = eye`] \(I find it quite odd that a spring would literally be, water eye, but what do I know). `mee' thayan` is then lit. eye strong/firm, which we suspect means :sol[`mee' thayan = awake`] rather than sound asleep or tired. 

Then, `mee' weep` and `weep thayan` are likely `tired` and `sound asleep` in some order; if we let :sol[`weep = sleep`], then :sol[`mee' weep = tired`] \(lit. eye sleep) and :sol[`weep thayan = sound asleep`] \(lit. sleep strong/firm). 

We then have `wik kiith`, `wik thayan`, `ma' thayan`, and `ma' puk pi'an` corresponding to one of `English language (E)`, `law (M)`, `thumb`, or `trustworthy (e.g. with belongings) (U)`. Two of these words include strong/firm: we suspect law and one of thumb/trustworthy. We guess that :sol[`ma' thayan = trustworthy (e.g. with belongings)`] \(lit. hand firm) because the phrasing implies security from theft, so :sol[`ma' puk pi'an = thumb`]. Then, :sol[`wik thayan - law`] and :sol[`wik kiith = English language`].

For **K2**,

> b. *bad* = :sol[way].

And for **K3**,
> a. weep = :sol[sleep]<br>
> b. ma' puk = :sol[finger] \(because thumb = big finger).
