The Chorote Iyo’awujwa’ are a Matacoan people living in the Chaco region of Argentina and Paraguay. A
linguist working with one of the varieties of Iyo’awujwa’ obtains the following data from a native speaker
(“sg.” and “pl.” mean “singular” and “plural”, respectively):

| | Iyo’awujwa’ | <div style="width: 30em;"> English </div> |
| - | --- | ---- |
| a. | a’wen | I see you (sg.), I see him/her/them |
| b. | a’weneɬ | I see you (pl.) |
| c. | si’wen | you (sg.) see me, he/she/they see me |
| d. | hi’wen | you (sg.) see him/her/them |
| e. | kasi’wen | you (sg.) see us, he/she/they see us |
| f. | in’wen | he/she/they see you (sg.) |
| g. | in’weneɬ | he/she/they see you (pl.) |
| h. | a’wena | we see you (sg.), we see him/her/them |
| i. | a’wenahaɬ | we see you (pl.) |
| j. | si’weneɬ | you (pl.) see me |
| k. | hi’weneɬ | you (pl.) see him/her/them |
| l. | kasi’weneɬ | you (pl.) see us |


The linguist then starts asking for other tenses. She asks how to say ‘you (sg.) are going to see me’ and gets
the form s*i’wehnayi’* from her consultant.

She says to herself, “I got this.” She asks her consultant, “Is ‘you (pl.) are going to see him/her/them’
*hi’wehnayiweɬ?*”

To her surprise, the form she gets is *in’wehnayiweɬ*. The consultant adds the following explanation: “it can
also mean ‘he/she/they are going to see you (pl.)’; and *si’wehnayi’* can also mean a few other things, by the
way: ‘I am going to see you (sg.)’, ‘I am going to see him/her/them’, and ‘he/she/they are going to see me’.”[^1]

**O1.** Translate into Iyo’awujwa’:

> a. you (sg.) are going to see him/her/them :ans{cl=large}
> b. he/she/they are going to see you (sg.) :ans{cl=large}
> c. you (sg.) are going to see us :ans{cl=large}
> d. you (pl.) are going to see us :ans{cl=large}
> e. we are going to see you (pl.) :ans{cl=large}

**O2.** Describe how to form the Iyo’awujwa’ verb meaning “see”. Be sure to reference the present (“see”) and
future (“going to see”) tenses in your answer.
