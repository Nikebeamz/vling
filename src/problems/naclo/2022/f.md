Ende is a Pahoturi River language spoken by 600 to 1,000 people in Western Province, Papua New Guinea.
Ende speakers are often multilingual due to marriages with speakers of other languages (e.g., Taeme and
Kawam). However, in this problem we focus only on Ende. The first part of an Ende story is given below, with
the English translation of each sentence directly below the Ende.[^1]

| Ende | English |

| Ankom a tärko ubi eragwaeya ddobae ai abal nag dagwaeya. |Ant and Small Fish, they were really | very good friends.
| Ankom obo ma me daeya llo toko me. |Ant was in his house on top of a tree. |
| Tärko walle me daeya ddob kollba nagnag oba peyang. |Small Fish was in the river with some fish | friends.
| Ttongo ag me däbe ttängäm a säresäremang gogon. |One morning that place was about to rain. |
| Yäbäd de ddapall käkan da dakonewän. |Clouds covered the sun. |
| Malla wätali gogon, wel ulle da gongkamän. |It wasn’t long before a big wind began. |

[^1]: Pronunciation notes:
<br>*‐ä* is a vowel similar to the first syllable of the English word about.
<br>*‐tt* is similar to *ch* in English (as in *church*), except that tt is retroflex, meaning that it is pronounced with the tip of the tongue
facing the back of the mouth.
<br>*‐dd* is similar to the first and last sounds of the English word *judge*, except that *dd* is retroflex.
<br>*‐ll* is similar to English *r* (as in *read*).
