Notice lines 3 and 6 have a common word, so :sol[*fil*=elephant]. Then, we can take advantage of sentence 3 to determine the syntax for Turkish simple sentences: SV.
It then follows that 7 translates to "The elephant jumped."

Now we can form a small Turkish vocabulary:

| Turkish | English |
| - | - |
| Balık | Fish |
| Yüzdü. | swam/verb equivalent |
| Zürafa | Giraffe|
| Koştu. | ran |
| atladı | jumped |
| **b.** :ans | The turtle ran for the fish. |

Since yüzdü is swim and 5 and 6 have two common words (swam and like), we can assume :sol[*gibi*=like]. This also gives us an insight for prepositional phrases in Turkish. Finally, we have SOPV as the Turkish syntax.

We can use sentence 4 to determine :sol[*için*=for] and :sol[*Kaplumbağa*=turtle]. **b** quickly follows as :sol[Kaplumbağa balık için koştu.]
