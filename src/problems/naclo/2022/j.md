title: Sounds Fishy

As a child learns to talk, they “acquire” the sound system of their language bit by bit, with some speech sounds appearing later than others. Unfortunately, some children have difficulties during this process, and may be referred to a speech therapist. One of the first things a therapist does is try to assess the state of the child’s sound “system”, and they sometimes do this by administering an “articulation test” in which the child is asked to name pictures and in this way pronounce a set of words specifically chosen to profile the child’s sound system.

Here are some examples slightly adapted from a genuine case: Scott, a 4-year-old British boy. Each example contains the target word (the word being pronounced) and Scott’s pronunciation (see below the tables for an explanation of the unfamiliar symbols). Note that, in this particular case, we are not interested in the vowels, which are all pronounced “correctly”.


| Target | Pronunciation | Target | Pronunciation | Target | Pronunciation  |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| church | dɜ:x | Christmas | gixməx | plane | bein |
| teeth | di:x | pencil | penduw | spoon | pu:n |
| fish | pix | flower | bauwə | toothbrush | du:xbux |
| yellow | jewou | smoke | hmouk | birthday | bɜ:xdei |
| stamps | danx | sneeze | hni:ɣ | loose | wu:x |
| queen | gi:n | wings | wiŋɣ | feather | peɣə |
| clouds | gauɣ | very | bewi | elephant | ewipənt |
| soldier | douɣə | sugar | dugə | bottle | boɁu |
| thumb | dum | monkey | munɁi | string | diŋg |


Pronunciation guide:

Ɂ is pronounced like the middle sound in “uh-oh”; x like the “ch” in “Bach”; ɣ like x but with vocal cords
vibrating; j like the “y” in “yes”; ŋ like the last sound in “sing”.
All transcriptions of vowel sounds are the same as the adult target. ə and ɜ are vowel sounds. The symbol :
indicates a long vowel. Note that the data comes from a British child, so the r is not pronounced in “soldier”,
“birthday”, etc.

**J1.** How would you predict that Scott would pronounce the following words? (Your answers should include
vowels, but you will not be graded on the specific vowels that you use.)

> (a) little :ans
(b) friends :ans
(c) please :ans
(d) chunky :ans
> 
> (e) quiz :ans
(f) smash :ans
(g) shrimps :ans

**J2.** What do you think Scott is saying here? Give one likely interpretation for each.

> (a) danɁ ju bewi mux :ans{cl=large} 
> (b) wox jo: hanɣ an bux jo: di:x :ans{cl=large}
