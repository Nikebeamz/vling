**A1.**

We reasonably guess that the Avoiuli script uses an alphabet, because we see a handful of repeats symbols, so each letter likely corresponds to either one or two letters in the transcription.

For filosofi, we notice that it starts and ends with `fi`, so we suspect that :sol[9 = filosofi]. We notice that `ti` is repeated twice in institiut, so :sol[4 = institiut]. Finally, because we recognize `lo` from filosofi from (a), so :sol[3, 6 = blong]. 

From institut, we note that 4 is written right-to-left (to let each letter in the script correspond to one letter in the transcription); examining the script further, it appears that the second and fourth rows are mirrored. 

**A2.**

We suspect that Bislama reduces double consonants to single ones. Examining village, we remember that we previously matched `il` from filosofi in A1.a, so :sol[14 = village]. The c in center likely turns into an `s` while the `t` remains the same, so :sol[2 = center]. Teaching likely preserves the `t`, so it is either 7 or 10, but because it doesn't end with an `i`, we conclude that :sol[7 = teaching]. Then, :sol[10 = technology], because we assume that `t` is also preserved in technology (checking the rest of the word, it appears to match). The `y` in humanity then becomes `i`, which we see from technology, so humanity is either 12 or 15. We recognize `u` from institiut, which appears in 12 and not 15, so :sol[12 = humanity].

**A3.**

Using the letters deduced from their matching words in A1 and A2, we can roughly transcribe every word; because the problem mentions geographical area, we suspect that the word won't be a specific island, but rather one of the bolded words, i.e. Micronesia, Melanesia, Australia, Polynesia, or Asia. Ignoring the words we have already matched, we quickly find that `5 = Melanesian`, so :sol[Melanesia] is mentioned on the sign.
