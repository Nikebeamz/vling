Mongo (also known as Nkundo or Lomongo) is a Bantu language spoken by the Mongo Peoples of the central
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Presently, there are around 400,000 native speakers spread out over a
large area around the Congo River.

Below is a table showing a few verb conjugations in Lomongo. [d͡ʒ] is a consonant pronounced like the [j] in
the English word jump. [ŋ] is a consonant pronounced like the [ng] at the end of the English word *sing*.

| Imperative | 2nd singular |  3rd singular | 3rd plural | English|
|-|-|-|-|-|
| bota | oota | aota |  baota | ‘beget’ (to give rise  to; to bring about) |
| kamba | okamba | akamba |  bakamba | ‘work’
| imed͡ʒa | wimed͡ʒa | imed͡ʒa |  bimedʒ͡a | ‘consent’
| usa | wusa | usa |  busa | ‘throw’
| bata | oata | aata |  baata | ‘get’
| ɛna | wɛna | ɛna |  bɛna | ‘see’
| isa | wisa | isa |  bisa | ‘hide’
| d͡ʒila | od͡ʒila | ad͡ʒila |  bad͡ʒila | ‘wait’
| ina | wina | ina |  bina | ‘hate’
| bina | oina | aina |  baina | ‘dance’
| asa | wasa | asa |  basa | ‘search’
| saŋga | osaŋga | asaŋga |  basaŋga | ‘say’

**A1.** Explain how these Mongo verb forms work by filling in the blanks below. Write your answers in the table
at the bottom of the page.

Each Mongo verb has a root form. The 4 verb forms shown here are formed by adding a prefix before the
root form. The prefix for the imperative form is **(1)** :ans, the prefix for the 2nd singular form is **(2)** :ans,
the prefix for the 3rd singular form is **(3)** :ans, and the prefix for the 3rd plural form is **(4)** :ans. (Note
that some of these prefixes may be empty; to note this, write the symbol Ø-).
However, we are not done yet: to get the final verb form, we must apply some sound change rules. The
relevant rules are:
1. If there are two **(5)** :ans, in a row, delete **(6)** :ans.
2. Delete **(7)** :ans when it appears between two **(8)** :ans.
3. Change **(9)** :ans to **(10)** :ans when it appears before a **(11)** :ans.
There is one final wrinkle: the order that these rules are applied in matters. The rules must be applied in this
order: First apply rule **(12)** :ans, then rule **(13)** :ans, then rule **(14)** :ans.
