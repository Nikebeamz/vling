title: Password Confusion
points: 10
---

Mary, Larry, and Harry are three friends sharing an apartment. Unfortunately, their nosy neighbor Perry is
always trying to use their wifi, so Mary changes their wifi password frequently to thwart Perry’s efforts.
Whenever she changes the password, Mary texts the new password to Larry and Harry.

One day, Mary opens their wifi bill and can tell from the exorbitant charge that Perry has been using it again.
Since this can only mean that Perry is somehow reading their texts, Mary hires a company called the
Rearranging Expressions Organization (or REOrganization for short) to give her advice on making her
messages more secure. REOrganization advises her to send messages that can be decoded by the following
2-step process:

1. Convert the sentence to a question;
2. Read the first letter of each word in the question to yield the password.

As it turns out, Larry and Harry are not very inquisitive people, so they have never encountered questions
before. Therefore, Mary gives them the following example messages to show how the system works:

| Text message | Text message converted to a question | Decoded password |
|-|-|-|
| Deciphering each Alaskan license plate abbreviation is lovely. | Is deciphering each Alaskan license plate abbreviation lovely? | IDEAL PAL
| A new German exchange rate beneath a newspaper did assist national ambassadors. | Did a new German exchange rate beneath a newspaper assist national ambassadors? | DANGER BANANA
| Every industrial geographer hired through your legal action was yelling enthusiastic random stuff. | Was every industrial geographer hired through your legal action yelling enthusiastic random stuff? | WEIGHTY LAYERS


Why have this extra step of forming a question? The idea is that the initial letters from the original text
messages can also spell two-word chunks (DEAL PAIL, ANGER BANDANA, and EIGHTY LAWYERS), so
perhaps Perry will be thrown off the scent by these distractor phrases.

**G1.** Larry and Harry both seemed to understand the examples Mary showed them, so she began using this
system to encode the new passwords. It went swimmingly for the first few weeks, but then Larry and Harry
occasionally began to get the password wrong. On the next page are all of the messages Mary sent out, along
with the passwords that her roommates extracted from the messages. A few cells of the table have been left
blank; fill them in.


| Text message | Distractor password | Larry’s password guess | Harry’s password guess | Correct password |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Uplifting tales told extremely rapidly in New Guinea and Romania may reveal each storyteller’s trade secrets.| UTTERING ARMRESTS| MUTTERING ARRESTS| MUTTERING ARRESTS| MUTTERING ARRESTS
| Lively orangutans using discarded branches as tambourines can harmonize. | LOUD BATCH | CLOUD BATH | CLOUD BATH | CLOUD BATH
| Horned owls should endure every modern orange tree iguanas can offer next summer. | HOSE EMOTICONS | CHOSE EMOTIONS | SHOE EMOTICONS | SHOE EMOTICONS
| Every loud electronic creature that interesting odd numbers should provide at reunions should escape. | ELECTION SPARSE  | SELECTION SPARE | SELECTION PARSE | SELECTION SPARE
| Alligators that can launch airplanes may prosper. |AT CLAMP | MAT CLAP | CAT LAMP | MAT CLAP |
| Unions should identify novel geometric systems that one may possibly seek. | USING STOMPS | MUSING STOPS | SUING STOMPS | SUING STOMPS
| Happy animals that will investigate telescopes can hop. | HAT WITCH
| All North Dakotan deviled eggs should seem especially radiant today. | AND DESSERT
| Aardvarks may publicly label each spanning tree algorithm talented unicorns should enthusiastically see. | AMPLE STATUSES
| Anyone rabbits might surprise has elicited a response that has satisfied. | ARMS HEARTHS

Mary does not want all this confusion about the password scheme, so she switches to a different encoding
scheme: She will still send out a message, but her roommates will now need to negate the message so that it
means the opposite of its original meaning, rather than turning it into a question as previously. Shockingly,
Larry and Harry are such positive people that they have never encountered negation before, so Mary sends
them the following examples of how the encoding scheme works:

| Text message | Negated text message | Decoded password |
|-|-|-|
|Charming refrigerator operators will waltz into Greenland. |Charming refrigerator operators will not waltz into Greenland. |CROWN WIG
|Quiet utilitarians in crowded Kenyan city halls are talking. | Quiet utilitarians in crowded Kenyan city halls are not talking. | QUICK CHANT


**G2.** Larry and Harry understood these examples just fine, but once again Mary found them making some
errors in future weeks when she sent out the actual encoded passwords! The following table contains some
of the messages Mary sent out; fill in the blank spaces.

| Text message | Distractor password | Larry’s password guess | Harry’s password guess | Correct password
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Denmark’s emptiest factory is exporting some pasta Russia is cooking each Saturday.| DEFIES PRICES
| Unions Nepal is forbidding over recent major events during breakfast are keeping exceptional records. |UNIFORMED BAKER

At this point, Mary decides to simply tell Larry and Harry the passwords in person.

Note: The problem that these three friends face is that the examples Mary sent out were consistent with multiple possible rules. In linguistics, this type of problem is called the poverty of the stimulus, and it is a central
topic in language acquisition: How is it that all children with English-speaking parents learn essentially the
same version of English, even though the sentences that they hear are consistent with many possible rules for
defining the structure of the language?
