title: The Pimpled Toad

Below is a famous Miao folk tale, “The Pimpled Toad who was Wise,” written in the Large Flowery Miao
language, which is spoken by about 300,000 people in Weining Autonomous County, Guizhou, China. Large
Flowery Miao is generally written in two different scripts: the *Pollard* script, created in 1904 by the English
missionary Samuel Pollard, as well as Miao Pinyin, which uses Roman script. Below is the Pollard script version.

On the next page is an English translation of the “The Pimpled Toad.” Of course, not every word in the English translation has an equivalent word in Miao; on the other hand, some English words may be translated by
more than one Miao word. Also, note that constructions of the form “I want to eat you / you want to eat
me” are written in Miao as “I want to eat your flesh / you want to eat my flesh.”

<p><b>The Pimpled Toad that was Wise.</b></p>
They say that a crow went to meet a pimpled toad. The crow said, “Toad, I want to eat you.”
The toad said, “You want to eat me, but my flesh is very bitter. If you want to eat me, you want
to carry me over there, to the stream, to the bank of the pool of water. Wash me in water, then
eat to get my flesh.” The crow replied, “Toad, I want to eat you, so there!” The crow stretched
his head upwards, laughing ha-ha. The toad jumped, hopped down to the pool water, and was
gone. The crow waded in the water to seek the toad, sought him, but did not get him. The crow
simply stretched his head, cawed, and said, “Ah-ah, all for nothing! Ah-ah, all for nothing!”

Finally, here is the Miao Pinyin transcription. However, there are some changes:
- The sentences, including the title, are in random order.
- Five of the sentences have been divided into two parts.
- Punctuation has been removed.
- The numbered blanks (e.g. :u[**18**] ) mark places where one or more words are missing.

Note that the diacritics (accent marks) ´, `, ¯, ˜ represent tones; ieh and w are vowels/vowel sequences; gh,
dl, tl, dr, and tr are consonants; n marks nasalization of the following consonant, that is, air flow escapes
through the nose and the mouth simultaneously during the production of the consonantal sound.
