Examining {1}, we note that `wə` appears in {1,3,4,7}, and `w` appears in {2}—so `wə` = `you(sg)`. 

We note that `tʷən`/`tʷan` appears in every sentence—hence it means `give`. We need to determine when to use `ə` vs. `a`. 

We note that pronouns are each one or two letters. Verb structure seems to be in the form `[object][indirect object][subject][verb]`. 

We predict that the indirect object may be omitted (it is implied) if it is in third person (i.e. him/them). 

Hence:
1. `s-` = `I/me` (1st person, singular) from {2,3,5,9}
2. `šʼ` = `we/us` (1st person, plural) from {1,6,7}
2. `w-` = `you` (2nd person, singular) from {1,2,3,4,7}
3. `šʷ-` = `you` (2nd person, plural) from {5,8,9} 
4. `n-` = `he`, `na` = `they` (3rd person, subject) from {6, 8} 
5. `a-` = `him/them` (3rd person, object) from {3,9} (note that this creates two different translations)

In `tʷ?n`, we use `a` if the object is plural or if the sentence contains `you(pl)` and `ə` otherwise, from examining {3,5,6,8}. 

We note that the object usually takes on the vowel `ə` unless the indirect object is `them` (3rd person plural), in which case it takes on the vowel `a`. The indirect object always takes `ə`.

**(a)** The last of the nine forms above can actually be translated into English in two ways.
What is its other translation?

> :sol[I give them to you$_\text{pl}$]{.solText}


**(b)** Translate into English:

> 10. ašʼəntʷən :sol[They give him to us]{.st}
> 11. səŝʷtʷan :sol[You$_\text{pl}$ give me to him]{.st}
> 12. šʼəwənatʷan :sol[They give us to you$_\text{sg}$]{.st}

**(c)** Translate into Ubykh:

> 13. they give you$_\text{pl}$ to me :sol[šʷəsənatʷan]{.st}
> 14. you$_\text{pl}$ give him to me :sol[asəšʷtʷan]{.st}
> 15. you$_\text{sg}$ give us to him :sol[šʼəwtʷan]{.st}
> 16. we give you$_\text{sg}$ to them :sol[wašʼtʷən]{.st}
> 17. he gives them to us :sol[ašʼəntʷan]{.st}
