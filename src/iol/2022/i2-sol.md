We notice that the first half-ish of words in Alabama look similar, and they end in either `-ka` or `-i`, which, combined with a skim over the unsorted English translations, suggests that each word has a "root" and that the suffixes imply singular/plural **OR** active/passive voice. 

Counting, we get the following groups:

| Alabama word #s | Words | Root | Count |
| - | - |  - | - |
| {1,2} | achánnàaka, achanni | achan- | 2 | 
| {3,4} | ahamatli, ahámmatka | aham- | 2 |
| {5,6,7} | apòotka, apotòoli, apóttòoka | apot- | 3 |
| {8,9,10} | atanayli, atánnayka, atanni | atan- | 3 |
| {11,12,13} | bàalka, balàali, balli | bal- | 3 |
| {14} |incháffàaka|inchaf- | 1 |
| {15} |kawaɬɬi | kawaɬ- | 1 |
| {16,17,18,19,20}|ɬìilka, ɬìipka, ɬilaffi, ɬipli, ɬíppìika|ɬil-/ɬip- | 5, 3/2 |
| {21,22,23,24} | ɬobaffi, ɬómbafka, ɬombi, ɬòomka | ɬom | 4 |
| {25,26} | sibapli, simbi | sim- | 2 |

(I would make another table for the English words but trust me on my counting.)

We find that the `ɬi-` group is associated with `next to something`/`against something`; specifically, 
- `ɬil-` = `against something` {D,I,S},  
- `ɬip-` = `next to something` {G,N}. 

We note that the three English groups with 3-count are 
- `wrap` (C, K, Z), which has 1 passive phrase (K),
- `lay` (B, L, V), which has 1 passive phrase (L) 
- `turn` (E, H, Q), which has 2 passive phrases (H, Q). 
	- Hence `apot-` = `turn` and
	- :sol[6 = E]{.solText}

On the other hand, `wrap` *only* has singular subjects, but each 3-count Alabama group has at least one of `-ka` and `-i` respectively, so we conclude that `-ka`/`-i` indicate passive/active voice such that:
- `-ka` = passive voice
- `-i` = active voice

We also find that `ɬom-` = `hole` (J, O, P, W), so
- {22, 24} = {J, W},
- {21, 23} = {O, P}.
