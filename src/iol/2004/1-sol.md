We first note `kêt` in {1,6,7,8}, so we conclude that `kêt=not`. 

Our attention is then drawn to `mẽ`, but we first refrain from drawing conclusions. 

We examine verbs (noting that each sentence is in present tense): 
1. `rê` = `swimming`
2. `ku` = `devouring`
3. `hê` = `decorating`
4. `to` = `dancing`

When the sentence is negated (i.e. in the presence of `kêt`), the verb gains a suffix (`-r+vowel`). 

The prefix indicates a pronoun (our first thought is that it indicates the object, by examining {2,4,6,7}):
1. `a-` = `you` 
2. `i-` = `me`

Note that if the verb root begins with `h`, we add `n` to the prefix (i.e. `inhê`, rather than `ihê`) (from {2,7}.

The only phrases of confusion are thus `mẽ`, `ba`, `ga`, `ije`, and `aje`. 

We note that `mẽ` pluralizes nouns (either subject or object).
- can be placed before OR after the independent subject (if it exists)
- placed before the verb form

We return to our prefix rule and note that two cases exist:
1. the sentence is negated (i.e. `kêt` exists), in which case the prefix indicates the SUBJECT UNLESS a subject is supplied earlier
	1. the subject is suffixed `-je` and uses the same pronoun prefixes (i.e. `i-` and `a-`)
2. the sentence is NOT negated, in which case the prefix always indicates an OBJECT, and a subject is ALWAYS supplied earlier
	1. the subject is `ga` = `you` and `ba` = `I`

**Assignment 1.** Translate into English; if you believe that some sentences have several
translations, give all of them:
> Aje ikuru kêt = :sol[You are not devouring me]{.solText}
>
> Ba mẽ aku = :sol[I am devouring you guys *or* We are devouring you]{.solText}
>
> Irêrê kêt = :sol[I am not swimming]{.solText}

**Assignment 2.** Translate into Kayapo:
> You guys are not devouring us = :sol[Mẽ aje mẽ ikuru kêt]{.solText}
>
> We are not decorating you guys = :sol[Mẽ ije mẽ anhêrê kêt]{.solText}
>
> We are dancing = :sol[Ba mẽ to]{.solText}
>
> I am devouring you = :sol[Ba aku]{.solText}
