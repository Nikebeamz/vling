			<h1>Notes</h1>
			<p>If anyone has non-official contest problems written and would like me to add them here, please create a pull request or DM me!</p>

			<p>In the meantime, I'll slowly be adding existing NACLO, IOL, and APLO problems with solutionsâ€”solutions will likely come out at a <i>much</i> slower rate than problem statements.</p>

			<h3>Contributing</h3>
			<p><b>Adding questions:</b> All pull requests to add questions are welcome! The only guideline is to ensure that everything in the <i>original question statement/PDF</i> exists in the <code>.md</code> file you create; as long as it reasonably mimics the original and is readable, we will accept it.</p>
			<p><b>Adding solutions:</b> If you are adding a solution to a problem <i>without</i> a solution, create a file called <code>[problem]-sol.md</code> and write up your solution! Make sure to use the sol directive and ensure that everything in the <i>original answer key</i> is contained in your solution somewhere. If the problem already has a solution but you'd like to add a <i>different</i> solution, add a heading labeling each solution with the writer. If you'd like to update/expand on an existing solution, ensure that you are not deleting significant parts of it and submit a pull request!</p>
			<p>Custom markdown reference <Link to="../cust">here</Link>.</p>
			<p><b>Typos/issues/bugs/problems:</b> Please submit a pull request or DM me!</p>


			<h3>Search</h3>
			<p>The search is built with <a href="https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html" taget="_blank">lunr</a>, so you can try wildcards (*), fuzzy matches (~), and term presences (+/-).</p> 

			<p>Try "search everything" to search every problem's full text. Try "tags only" to search only through the problem name and my selected tags, which include for now the <i>language used</i>, <i>location</i>, and the <i>type of problem</i>.</p>
			<p>Tags for types of problems:</p>

			<ul>
			{tagDescs.map(function(item, i) {return <li><b><Link to={"/search?q="+item["name"]+"&tags=true"}>{item["name"]}</Link></b>, {item["desc"]}</li>})}
			</ul>
