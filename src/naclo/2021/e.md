Mandombe is a script, or writing system, created in 1978 by Wabeladio Payi. Today, it is used to write the
Democratic Republic of the Congo’s four national languages — Kongo, Lingala, Tshiluba, and Swahili.
According to legend, the script was revealed to Payi by Congolese prophet Simon Kimbangu in a dream.[^1]
[^1]: That’s not all for the backstory — at one point, the script landed Payi in trouble with the authorities. The problem was related to the fact that in
traditional Kongo culture, mirrors are powerful, magical devices. Evidently, something about the script was too mirror-like.

[^2]: Kongo, also called Kikongo, is a language of the Bantu family spoken natively by about 7 million people in central Africa. It is also widely learned and
used as a second language in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and has served as a basis of several creole languages in Africa and the Americas.
